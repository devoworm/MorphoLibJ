  Abstract                 = {Summary: NucleusJ is a simple and user-friendly ImageJ plugin dedicated to the characterization of nuclear morphology and chromatin organization in 3D. Starting from image stacks, the nuclear boundary is delimited by combining the Otsu segmentation method with optimization of nuclear sphericity. Chromatin domains are segmented by partitioning the nucleus using a 3D watershed algorithm and by thresholding a contrast measure over the resulting regions. As output, NucleusJ quantifies 15 parameters including shape and size of nuclei as well as intra-nuclear objects and their position within the nucleus. A step-by-step documentation is available for self-training, together with data sets of nuclei with different nuclear organization.Availability and implementation: Dataset of nuclei is available at https://www.gred-clermont.fr/media/WorkDirectory.zip. NucleusJ is available at http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?Â id=Â plugin:Â stacks:nuclear_analysis_plugin:start.Contact: philippe.andrey@versailles.inra.fr and christophe.tatout@univ-bpclermont.frSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract  = {Abstract A sound understanding of the microstructure of dairy products is of great importance in order to predict and control their properties and final quality. The aim of this study was to develop an automated image analysis procedure to characterize the microstructure of different dairy systems. A high pressure freezing coupled with freeze-substitution (HPF-FS) protocol was applied prior to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in order to minimize any modification of the microstructure of the dairy systems investigated. The developed image analysis procedure was first validated on synthetic images of suspensions, and then on two types of concentrated milk suspensions. Microstructural data relating to casein micelles in milk suspensions were taken from the literature. The established procedure was then applied to the two corresponding rennet-induced milk gels, prepared from the same milk concentrates used for suspensions preparation. The automated image analysis procedure allowed the reliable estimation of several characteristic microstructural parameters including area fraction, porosity, boundary length per unit area, particle aggregate size, inter-particle aggregate distance and tortuosity. The relative ease of estimating these microstructural parameters from the automated image analysis method could make it useful for routine measurements of milk gels. Moreover, the method enabled a useful discrimination between two different types of milk gels. This novel approach can contribute to a better understanding of the effects of processing on the structure-property relationships in dairy products, and may be applied to other food systems.},

  abstract  = {This paper consists of a tutorial overview of morphological filtering, a theory introduced in 1988 in the context of mathematical morphology. Its first section is devoted to the presentation of the lattice framework. Emphasis is put on the lattices of numerical functions in digital and continuous spaces. The basic filters, namely the openings and the closings, are then described and their various versions are listed. In the third section morphological filters are defined as increasing idempotent operators, and their laws of composition are proved. The last sections are concerned with two special classes of filters and their derivations: first, the alternating sequential filters allow us to bring into play families of operators depending on a positive scale parameter. Finally, the center and the toggle mappings modify the function under study by comparing it, at each point, with a few reference transforms.},

  abstract  = {With the progress of microscopy techniques and the rapidly growing amounts of acquired imaging data, there is an increased need for automated image processing and analysis solutions in biological studies. Each new application requires the design of a specific image analysis pipeline, by assembling a series of image processing operations. Many commercial or free bioimage analysis software are now available and several textbooks and reviews have presented the mathematical and computational fundamentals of image processing and analysis. Tens, if not hundreds, of algorithms and methods have been developed and integrated into image analysis software, resulting in a combinatorial explosion of possible image processing sequences. This paper presents a general guideline methodology to rationally address the design of image processing and analysis pipelines. The originality of the proposed approach is to follow an iterative, backwards procedure from the target objectives of analysis. The proposed goal-oriented strategy should help biologists to better apprehend image analysis in the context of their research and should allow them to efficiently interact with image processing specialists.},

  abstract = {Digital topology deals with the topological properties of digital images: or, more generally, of discrete arrays in two or more dimensions. It provides the theoretical foundations for important image processing operations such as connected component labeling and counting, border following, contour filling, and thinningand their generalizations to three- (or higher-) dimensional images. This paper reviews the fundamental concepts of digital topology and surveys the major theoretical results in the field. A bibliography of almost 140 references is included.},
